# Trading-Algorithms-Analysis
This project analyses multiple trading algorithms which give useful insights on the Indian and American stock markets.

1. TradingView
This project uses PineScript on the platform Tradingview to backtest and analyze multiple 3 algorithms. You can analyse these algorithms on all the stocks and financial markets supported on TradingView. This includes Nifty50 (India), S&P500 (USA), DAX (Germany), etc. Two useful insights derived from this analysis:
•	Bullish trades have significantly more accuracy and reward/risk ratio than bearish trades. Therefore it is better to stick with bullish trades only.
•	Higher timeframes like weekly and monthly have more profit potential and less account drawdown compared to lower timeframes like hourly or even the daily. Therefore it is better to stick to timeframes higher than the daily. Also, if you’re an options seller, you get more profit and stability from theta decay if you stick to higher timeframes. For example, taking a 45 DTE trade is going to be much more profitable than taking a 7 DTE trade because of the extra theta decay and stability.

2. Nifty50
This project analyses 3 algorithms on Nifty50 stocks and determines which one gives more stability and accuracy compared to the other 2. This project can be extended to backtest other algorithms on Nifty50 stocks and compare their performances with the existing ones.
